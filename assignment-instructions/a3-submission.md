# Submitting your work
When you've completed your work in MATLAB Online, you need to upload the deliverables to GitHub. Use the following steps: 
1. Make sure each of your deliverables uses the proper filename (see below).
1. Use the MATLAB Online interface or MATLAB Drive to download each file to your local computer.
1. Upload each file into the **top-level** directory of your assignment GitHub repository (e.g., **do not** submit your figure into the `/Figs` directory). 

Ensure that you upload or create each of the following files: 
- A **function** named ```my_lucky_numbers.m``` (Created during [Lesson 2](a3-lesson2))
- A **figure** named ```lucky_numbers.png``` (Created during [Lesson 2](a3-lesson2))
- A **function** named ```simple_stats.m``` (Created during [Lesson 3](a3-lesson3))
- A **script** named ```process_adelaide.m``` (Created during [Lesson 4](a3-lesson4))
- A **function** named ```plot_station_data.m``` (Created during [Lesson 5](a3-lesson5))
- A **Markdown** document named ```reflection.md``` that provides a very short reflection on your experience
